The constricting play zone API allows other components to poll things about the zone's current state (for example, for
UI). The zone itself exposes this state to both server and client and handles networking of data itself. Only one play
zone is supported.

Each phase of the zone consists of a static time followed by a closing time.
Phases:
0               not active
1 - PhaseCount  active and non-zero size
> PhaseCount    active and zero size

Constricting play zone state is represented by the following table:
{
    int phase                                       Current phase
    int numPhases                                   Total number of phases
    bool isZoneClosing                              If the zone is currently closing
    float timeToClosing                             If not closing, time until it will be (otherwise nil)
    float timeToStatic                              If closing, time until it finishes (otherwise nil)
    Vector3 currentZoneCenter                       Center of the zone right now
    float currentZoneRadius                         Radius of the zone right now
    Vector3 nextPhaseCenter                         Center of the zone next phase
    float nextPhaseRadius                           Radius of the zone next phase
}

If the phase is 0 the other values will be missing except numPhases.
