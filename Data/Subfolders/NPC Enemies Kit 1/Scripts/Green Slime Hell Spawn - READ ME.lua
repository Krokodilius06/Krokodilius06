* XRS NPC - Green Slime Hell Spawn

This NPC is a major derivative of the Gelantinuos Cube Enemy created by
BryceLovesGaming.  It like most of the NPC's in this kit contains
Added Audio and Visual FX's.

This NPC was designed to be like the Micheal Myers of NPCs.  Slowly
moving towards the player, exceptionally hard to kill.  Best taken
out using Projectile Weapons.  This NPC is designed to cause players
to retreat when combating it.  Great for driving people back down
hallways and such.

It only causes damage when it comes into contact with a player.
The Amount of Damage is setup as a custom property (Health Change) in the 
"Poison Contact Zone" Object inside the NPC.
