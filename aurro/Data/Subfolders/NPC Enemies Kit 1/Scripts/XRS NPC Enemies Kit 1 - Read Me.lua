Brought to you by Chaz Scholton, Nya Alchemi and SusWitch


Thank you for downloading this collection of NPC's.

You may need to update the NPCAI Kit scripts of these NPC's to match the version
of the NPCAI Kit which your game project or game framework uses.

This kit consists of

* XRS NPC - Green Slime Hell Spawn
* XRS NPC [Alchemi] - Mutant/Alien Raptor
* XRS NPC - Mutant/Alien Gel Boss
* XRS NPC - Jump Scare - Wicked Hell Spawn
* XRS NPC - Orc Warrior - Red tones


All these NPC's with the exception of the Orc Warrior were used in the
Core Collapse game.   


>>>>>> NOTE <<<<<<<<<

The Orc Warrior NPC is setup to work with the Dungeon Crawler Game Framework
which is using an older version of the NPCAI kit.  You may or may not need
to update the scripts to get it to work with Games using a Newer Versions of
the NPCAI Kit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* XRS NPC - Jump Scare - Wicked Hell Spawn

The Wicked Hell Spawn Jump Scare are none combative, none killable NPCS
which surrround the player for a temporary period of time.  Treat this
group of NPC's to being on par with an Illusion or literally not from
the same dimension.

* XRS NPC - Green Slime Hell Spawn

This NPC is a major derivative of the Gelantinuos Cube Enemy created by
BryceLovesGaming.  It like most of the NPC's in this kit contains
Added Audio and Visual FX's.

This NPC was designed to be like the Micheal Myers of NPCs.  Slowly
moving towards the player, exceptionally hard to kill.  Best taken
out using Projectile Weapons.  This NPC is designed to cause players
to retreat when combating it.  Great for driving people back down
hallways and such.

It only causes damage when it comes into contact with a player.
The Amount of Damage is setup as a custom property (Health Change) in the 
"Poison Contact Zone" Object inside the NPC.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------


A lot of time, love and energy went into all these NPC's.
